Testing Parameters:

	Times to run: 150

	Minimum Search Radius: 5.000000
	Search Radius Step: 5.000000
	Maximum Search Radius: 15.000000

	Time Radius: 5.000000

	Ride Request Score Calculations: 

		Distance Calculated by: Pythagorean Theorem
		Time To Distance Ratio: 1:1

		Pickup_Distance = Distance from car to pickup point (could also use time to arrive at pickup)
		Ride_Distance = Distance from pickup to the car's destination (could also use time to arrive at destination)
		Requests_At_Destination = Requests projected to exist at the destination point + Requests scheduled near destination at arrival time

		Requests_At_Destination_Ceiling = Minimum number of requests available at destination to result in no penalty to score = 30
		Ride_Distance_Weight = Coeficient used to determine relative value of the distance of the trip = 0.002000

		PercentageValueOfTrip = ((Ride_Distance)/(Ride_Distance + Pickup_Distance)) * 10
		ValueOfTripDistance = (Ride_Distance * Ride_Distance_Weight) * 10
		DestinationPenalty:
			If Requests_At_Destination > Requests_At_Destination_Saturation, DestinationPenalty = 0
			Otherwise, DestinationPenalty = -3 + (Requests_At_Destination * (3/Requests_At_Destination_Ceiling))

		Request_Score = PercentageValueOfTrip + ValueOfTripLength + DestinationPenalty
